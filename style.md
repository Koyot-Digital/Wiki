# Rules for styling
* don't insult the reader.
* don't spread misinformation unless it is clearly stated/for an Easter egg.
* refer to the reader as "you", do not use "we" or "us" it sounds like ***we*** are in a hive mind 
* for catchphrases, try to put a joke or meme in, cause who doesn't love a joke?
* for images: use 1 graphics, this is so that stuff stays readable, and people with lower end systems can contribute.
