# Rules for styling

- don't insult the reader.
- don't spread misinformation unless it is clearly stated/for an Easter egg.
- refer to the reader as "you", do not use "we" or "us" it sounds like **_we_** are in a hive mind
- for catchphrases, try to put a joke or meme in, cause who doesn't love a joke?
- for images (such as ones in the control room): use 1 graphics, this is so that stuff stays readable.
- for images (such as hero banners): use the graphics setting that looks best for the photo.



## Iconography & Typography

### Typography
- H1 should only be used in the page title/hero.
- H2 should be used for section headers
- H3 should be used for sub-sections
- H4-H6 Should ***not*** be used as they are too small, and are basicly `<p>` tags.

### Iconography
- Use [HeroIcons](https://heroicons.com/) for icons.
- Icons should be sized with `size-4` to `size-6`, with a stroke of `1` or `1.5`.
- try to aim for good contrast, at least a [WCAG AA](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/) score.
