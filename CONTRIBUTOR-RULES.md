# GitHub Standards

## Readability
When you make changes to the wiki, you must make sure you comment
on your work/code, and when making a commit, you must say what you
have changed in the commit clearly. Speak like you're giving an
action.
#### For Example:
- "fix: typo in about section"
- "add: mobile responsiveness to navigation"
- "edit: contact information"

## Branches
When working on a feature, make sure to make a new branch for
this so you do not commit directly into the main branch.
You must do your work in your branch, and when it is ready
for production, you may make a pull request to merge it into
the main branch. Only the creator of the branch should make
pull requests for the branch.

## Pull Requests
When you submit a pull request, you should make sure you include
the following:
- A clear title summarizing the changes
- Description of what was changed and why
- Any relevant issue numbers (if applicable)


### Other
Keep it to one change per commit. Make sure not to make a
bunch of unrelated changes in one commit. If your commit is about
organizing files, organize them, then when you do the next
step, make sure that in another commit. In other words, make sure
commits are related.


As Stated in the sections, provided failure to adhere to these rules may result in moderation or removal of the contributor status.
